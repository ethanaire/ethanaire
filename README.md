### Hey, I'm Hoang (Ethan) Nguyen! :v: 

I'm a Macquarie University graduate majoring in Information System and Business Analysis. My current job as a Service Analyst at Viettel Networks have started since October 2023.

Studying abroad gives me the chance to immerse myself in many different works and projects, helping to improve my coding skill as well as analytical thinking. I'm always trying to grow and learn something new besides my leisure time for games. :heart_eyes:

### What I'm focusing on :computer:

Currently improving my analytical skills: Python, R, SQL and trying to get a internship during my summer break. 

### Find me elsewhere :earth_asia:
